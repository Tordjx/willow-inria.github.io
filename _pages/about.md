[Willow](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) is a joint team between 
[Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-paris-centre), the [computer science department of ENS Paris](https://www.di.ens.fr/set_english), and [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en).
We do research in **computer vision, machine learning, robotics, optimization and control**. 

The Willow team was founded in 2007 by [Jean Ponce](https://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce/) as a research team studying representational issues in visual object recognition and scene understanding, with the objective to develop geometric, physical, and statistical models for all components of the image interpretation process, including illumination, materials, objects, scenes, and human activities. 
Since 2019, the Willow team has started a new research track centered around robotics.
Since 2023, the team is headed by [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io).

The research done in Willow revolves around three main axis:
-  Visual recognition and reconstruction of images and videos,
-  Image restoration and enhancement,
-  Learning embodied representations for robotics.

Willow also develops [impactful software](https://willow-inria.github.io/software/) centered around its research activities, which is today used in both academia and industry sectors.
