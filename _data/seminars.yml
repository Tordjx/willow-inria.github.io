      abstract: Direct methods for optimal control, also known as trajectory optimization, is a workhorse for optimization-based control in robotics and beyond. Nonlinear programming with engineered initializations has been the de-facto approach for trajectory optimization, which however, can suffer from undesired local optimality. In this talk, I will first show that, using the machinery of sparse moment and sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxations, many nonconvex trajectory optimization problems can be solved to certifiable global optimality. That is, globally optimal solutions of the original nonconvex problems can be computed by solving convex semidefinite programs (SDPs) together with optimality certificates. I will then present a specialized SDP solver implemented in CUDA (C++) and runs in GPUs that exploits the structures of the problems to solve the convex SDPs at a scale far beyond existing solvers. Lastly, I will discuss several ongoing efforts in our group towards deploying the certifiable optimal control algorithms in real-world robots

      abstract: Mathematical and computational tools are ubiquitous nowadays, and optimization in various disciplines leads to problems in very different settings. In this talk we discuss finite-dimensional constrained structured programming in the fully nonconvex setting, capturing a variety of problems that include nonsmooth objectives, disjunctive structures, and nonlinear, set-membership constraints. The augmented Lagrangian framework is extended to cover this broad problem class, with established asymptotic properties and convergence guarantees under mild assumptions. Then, we illustrate a technique to avoid slack variables, treating them as implicit variables and taking advantage of certain oracles available. Finally, we will indicate the theoretical challenges that arise in this unexplored territory.
